# Embedding-Based Query with RAG

## Project Description

This project is a query answering application under the name **Embedding-Based Query with RAG**. The project aims to produce more accurate and contextually appropriate results by combining **embedding-based similarity calculation** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques.

The project meaningfully compares user queries with texts in a database. **Sentence Transformers** model is used to create **vector representations (embeddings)** for the texts and the query. Then, similarities between these vectors are calculated, and the closest text is found. This information is sent to a language model via the **Groq API**, generating a contextually appropriate response.

## Technologies Used

- **Sentence Transformers**: Used to convert texts into vectors and perform similarity calculations.
- **Groq API**: Used to interact with a large language model and perform the RAG process.
- **PyTorch and NumPy**: Used for mathematical computations and similarity measurements.

## Project Workflow

1. **Calculating Embeddings**:
    - The user query and texts in the database are converted into vectors using the **Sentence Transformers** model.
    - These vectors numerically represent the meanings of the texts.

2. **Similarity Calculation**:
    - Similarities between the query and texts are calculated using the **Cosine Similarity** method.
    - The text with the highest similarity score is selected as the "closest text."

3. **Using RAG**:
    - The closest text and the user query are combined into a **prompt**.
    - This prompt is sent to a large language model via the **Groq API**.
    - The model generates a contextually appropriate response.

4. **Response**:
    - The response generated by the model is printed on the screen.

## Example Usage

### Database:
```
database = [
    {"name": "Luxury Hotel with Sea View", "description": "If you are looking for a luxury hotel with a sea view, this hotel is perfect for you."},
    {"name": "Budget City Hotel", "description": "Ideal for those looking for an affordable hotel in the city center."},
    {"name": "Comfortable Hotel Near the Airport", "description": "A perfect option for those looking for a comfortable hotel near the airport."},
    {"name": "Bungalow in Nature", "description": "Bungalows for a peaceful vacation surrounded by nature."},
    {"name": "Family-Friendly Resort", "description": "A family-friendly resort offering activities for children."}
]
```
### Query:
```
query = "I am looking for a vacation spot surrounded by nature"
```

### Output:

- **Closest Text**: "Bungalows for a peaceful vacation surrounded by nature."
- **Groq Response**: "This vacation spot offers an experience surrounded by nature and provides a peaceful environment."


## Conclusion

This application combines **embedding-based similarity calculation** and **RAG** methods to analyze database data related to a query and generate accurate responses using this data. It provides both a semantic and data-driven approach.
