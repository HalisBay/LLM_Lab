# LLM Lab

This project is a laboratory environment that includes various artificial intelligence and natural language processing (NLP) applications. The project performs operations such as text-based querying, image generation, and embedding-based similarity calculation with different submodules.

## Subprojects

### 1. **Image Generation with AI API**
- **Description**: Generates images based on text descriptions provided by the user.
- **Technologies**: Hugging Face API, Stable Diffusion model.
- **More Information**: [create_image_with_ai/readme.md](./create_image_with_ai/readme.md)

### 2. **Embedding-Based Query with RAG**
- **Description**: Compares user queries with texts in a database and generates the most appropriate response using the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) method.
- **Technologies**: Sentence Transformers, Groq API.
- **More Information**: [embedding-based_query_with_RAG/readme.md](./embedding-based_query_with_RAG/readme.md)

### 3. **Embedding-Based Text Similarity Search and Visualization**
- **Description**: Compares user queries with texts, calculates similarity scores, and visualizes the results.
- **Technologies**: Sentence Transformers, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **More Information**: [embedding_base_search/readme.md](./embedding_base_search/readme.md)
